               <h2>Kansas City, MO</h2>
               <p>
                  Oh, Kansas City. Born and raised in one of the major suburbs of the city, I loved the brickwork of downtown and all the character KC held in all its finer details.

               <h2>St Louis, MO</h2>
               <p>
                  St Louis was a crazy place to live. Between race riots and violence, I still managed to find a life on the Hill. Working in downtown, I got to see a lot of the city and what made the gateway to the west unique in its own way.

               <h2>Corvallis, OR</h2>
               <p>
                  So far, I love my new home. Having been to both coasts now, I can say that I'm starting to gather experiences that are meaningful to me. Though Corvallis may not be my last stop, it is certainly a beautiful destination along the way.

                  <h4>Austin, TX</h4>
                  <p>
                     Austin is known to be a bumping city that is currently growing rapidly thanks to the thriving food, entertainment and traditional American cultures. I would love to be a part of the movement going on down there and that is why it made the list.

                  <h4>Virginia Beach, VA</h4>
                  <p>
                     VA Beach is of great personal importance to me. I have a lot of family located on the east coast and my grandmother lives in VA Beach. I would love to live close to my family and experience the beautiful beaches and boardwalk that are at the heart of VA Beach.

                  <h4>Berlin, Germany</h4>
                  <p>
                     I would love to live in Berlin for many reasons, including the historical significance as well as the fact that my parents met there. I've been told its a great town with a lot to do and the idea of seeing such history intertwined with modern culture excites me.
